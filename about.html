				<p class="sectionBody">My name is Lucas Zadrozny. I am a graduate of software engineering from the University of Wollongong in Australia. I currently live in Sydney where I work during the day, <a href="projects.html">tinker on the weekend</a> and <a href="astrophotography.html">take photos during the night</a>.</p>

				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Brief History</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">In 2002 I received my first computer (my dad's old 386 used during the early 90's). It ran Windows 3.1, and still had programs such as CorelDraw, Matlab and Turbo C installed.
					Roughly a year later I received a 486 upon which I installed Red Hat Linux 4.1. Using the tools provided on these PCs I began to learn the very basics of the C language.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">It wasn't until 2008 that I began to tackle real programming problems. I began by implementing a simple CTF game made using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_SDK">Source SDK</a>. I then spent 2009 and 2010 cleaning and extending the <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/Quake">original Quake engine</a>. Having then been exposed to game engine design I began my first real project: <a href="projects/pathways.html">Pathways into Darkness</a>.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Pathways into Darkness kept me busy from 2011 until the beginning of 2014, where it was overtaken by my <a href="projects/holodeck.html">final year university project</a>.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">After the university year concluded, I registered for <a href="http://www.hackagong.com">Hackagong</a> where I was one of four teams selected to create software for the Meta 1 augmented reality headset. My team created a prototype augmented reality video chat client using the Meta and a Kinect sensor. The project won Hackagong but ultimately proved to be a dead end due to the Kinect output not being anywhere near photorealistic.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">This led to 2015 where I entered the workforce armed with a fresh degree and a keen attitude. My first job out of the gate was on a 3 month contract as a Validation Engineer for ResMed. After my contract expired I moved to Cirrus Real Time Processing Systems where my first project "threw me into the middle of the Pacific Ocean" (opposed to the deep end of the pool) as put by one of the other employees. The project was successful and delivered on time.</p>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Other Hobbies</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">As long as I can remember I have been interested in astronomy. This interest was greatly strengthened shortly before the <a href="images/astro/VenusTransit.jpg">2012 transit of Venus</a>, where for the first time I observed the crescent Venus. Since then I've bought a proper telescope and camera (<a href="projects/pslr.html">and enhanced the setup when necessary</a>) enabling me to perform some astrophotography.</p>
				<br />
				<p class="sectionBody">When I require downtime, I also enjoy racing simulators such as <a href="http://www.lfs.net">Live for Speed</a> and <a href="http://www.iracing.com">iRacing</a>.</p>
