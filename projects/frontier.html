				<p class="sectionSubtitle">OVERVIEW</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Frontier is an upcoming original VR-simulation title that places users onto different planets within our solar system.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">This unique experience is delivered through a custom game engine that renders Digital Elevation Model (DEM) collected by NASA and ESA.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Frontier can run on both PC (HTC Vive and Oculus Rift) and Android (Samsung GearVR) devices. While the codebase is unified (the PC build can act as the Android version), these device types varying in their technical specifications and input methods. Because of this the user interface differs significantly between the PC and mobile versions. The PC version makes use of the HTC Vive's tracked motion controllers while Android version makes use of the GearVR's touchpad. Because of this specialisation the menu system feels native to each device.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Hardware isn't at the point where we can load a 30,000x80,000 DEM into memory and run it at real time (even in non-VR mode). Because of this Frontier contains a toolset which takes a NASA\ESA DEM and converts it into a number of smaller models of various sizes (see <a href ="http://tulrich.com/geekstuff/chunklod.html">Chunked Terrain</a>). This technique was chosen due to it's data structure lending itself to concurrent paging and low rendering overhead. Both of these properties are strengths in resource constrained environments such as an Android device.</p>
