				<p class="sectionSubtitle">OVERVIEW</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Overview goes here.</p>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBody">The major features of this project are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="sectionBody">Leap Motion integration into the Source Engine.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Gesture panels.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Custom gesture recognition.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Interactive world space GUI panels.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Multiple Leap Motion devices working within the same application (see <a href="giantleap.html">Giant Leap</a>).</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Positional head tracking for the Rift DK1.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Eletro-tactile interface integration.</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBody">The Holodeck system supports a large amount of hardware:</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="sectionBody">Oculus Rift (visual output).</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">1 or more Leap Motions (world interaction).</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">A joystick that supports pitch, roll and yaw (player movement).</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Razer Hydra (positional head tracking for the Rift DK1, not required for other Rift models).</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Electrotactile interface (interaction output, not required but enhances VR immersion).</li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBody">There are two types of users for the Holodeck system:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="sectionBody">End users simply setup all equipment required by the Holodeck system and launch a Holodeck ready game.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Developers create custom gestures, place gesture panels, tactile volumes and other entities within the VR world.</li>
				</ol>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Gesture Panels</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Gesture panels are invisible volumes that enable gesture based control of the world. There are 3 types of gesture panels supported by Holodeck:</p>
				<ol>
					<li class="sectionBody">Swipe - the user must swipe their hand in a predefined direction (or against the direction).</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Circle - the user must draw a circle in the air with their finger for a length of time.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">Tap - the user must "press a button" in a predefined direction.</li>
				</ol>
				<p class="sectionBody">Each of the above panels have fire map events that can be used by level designers to script different types of events. Shown below are examples.</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Swipe Panel (hula doll)
					********TODO*************</p>
				
				<p class="sectionBody">Circle Panel (door)
					********TODO*************</p>
				
				<p class="sectionBody">Tap Panel (vending machine)
					********TODO*************</p>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Gesture Detection</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">The Holodeck system allows developers to create custom gestures by specifying the relative angles of the users fingers (with a degree of forgiveness).</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">The Holodeck system provides the ability to "listen" for each gesture type (swipe, circle, tap) regardless of the users current location. 
					This allows level designers to perform player specific actions anywhere in the world (eg: swipe left to display the HUD, swipe right to hide).
					Programmers are able to extend this system by implementing dedicated gesture listeners which can detect custom gestures and use gesture information to modify the world in a more meaningful way. Level designers are free to activate and deactivate gesture listeners at runtime which allows for area specific gestures to be recognized and processed.
					********VIDEO OF EDEN, TUTORIAL FOR SETUP*************VIDEO OF GUI PANEL*************</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Some gestures require pure code detection and handling. These gestures should revolve around core gameplay (such as shooting a gun and picking up objects).*************VIDEO OF GUNS, PICKUP*************</p>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Electrotactile Interface</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">The Electrotactile Interface (referred to now as ETI) is a device that uses a range of electric pulses to provide the user with feedback from the VR environment.
					Much like gesture detection, the ETI can be powered through code and </p>
				<p class="sectionBody">With the addition of the ETI, the Holodeck system could cause large and prolonged amounts of physical pain to the user.
					Because of this, the code was required to be rock solid and very forgiving (such as disabling the device during loading screens, </p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Can be pure code (guns, UI, etc)</p>
				<p class="sectionBody">Integrated into Hammer, completely customizable</p>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Challenges</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="sectionBody">Feature Creep - </li>
				</ul>
				<br />
				
				<p class="sectionBodyBold">Lessons</p>
				<ul>
					<li class="sectionBody">Risk Management - Using unknown technology was risky. Using the Source Engine (a technology with which I was familiar) reduced the long term risk that another game engine would be too much to learn on top of the Rift, Leap, Hydra and Electrotactile Interface.</li>
					<li class="sectionBody">More features doesn't necessarily mean the product will be better. Sometimes it makes the product more complicated. Complete hardware setup time was usually around 10-15 minutes (more if the Giant Leap application was used).</li>
